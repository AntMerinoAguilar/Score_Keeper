# Score Keeper 🏆

This repository contains a **Score Keeper** project, created as part of my training. The objective of this exercise was to develop a simple app to keep track of scores in a ping-pong game.

## Overview 📋

In this project, I created a simple score tracker for a "Best of 5" ping-pong game. The application allows players to:

- Increment the score for each player using buttons.
- Automatically disable the buttons when 5 games are reached.
- Change the color of the winner's score to green and the loser's score to red.
- Reset the game using a reset button.

## Why This Project? 🤔

This exercise helped me practice:

- **JavaScript DOM manipulation** for dynamically updating the UI based on user interaction.
- **Event handling** through buttons to trigger actions like incrementing scores and resetting the game.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- JavaScript
- HTML5 

## Project Structure 📂

The repository contains:

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file with the structure for the game.
- **`app.js`**: JavaScript code handling the game logic.

## First Steps as a Developer 🚀

This project helped me understand the basics of DOM manipulation in JavaScript and how to handle events like button clicks to update the UI. It also reinforced the concept of state management by keeping track of player scores.
